# Take the Bait is a game developed by me and my friends Gavin, Harry, and Ricky for our game development class. We used Monogame in Visual Studio and coded in C#. I was responsible for the UI and visuals, though I worked on a lot of the back-end code too. The game is a vertical 2D-Scroller where the user has to catch as many fish as possible before hitting an obstacle.
